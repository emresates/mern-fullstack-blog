## Fullstack Blog Project (MERN)

### A simple blog project where I designed the frontend using react, context api and scss, and the backend using mongodb, express and nodejs. Since it was my first project as fullstack, I wanted to accomplish something simple.

### Register, login, posting, post edits and profile edits are available.
